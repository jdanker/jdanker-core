## On the Side - 
### [This website](/) 
My background is not web development. I am not a react or typescript wizard, but I think it's important for every developer to understand how the web works. Building and hosting my own website is a great way to understand the infrastructure of the internet.

*Why Hugo?*

Hugo means I don't need to do frontend development, and can just focus on projects I enjoy, and link them here. Hugo is also written in Go, making it easily modifieable and customizable.
