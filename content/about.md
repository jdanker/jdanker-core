## Currently:

### Professionally - 
For the past/first year of my professional career I have mostly been working with CI/CD processes and automated deployment at Mastercard. 

*What's that look like?*

A lot of chef, jenkins, and bash. 

### On the Side - 
#### [This website](www.jdanker.com) 
*Why Hugo?*

Originally I had a goal of building a personal website using React. I had built a project with Angular before, and my thought was *React is popular, right? I should learn that.* Turns out I don't love web development, especially the front end.

If you don't love doing something, it is extremely difficult to motivate yourself to learn it in your free time. So, I discovered the beauty of static site generators. 

Relatively straightforward to get setup, infinitely customizable. 

Hugo is also built on Go, which I am eager to dive into more. I don't work with object oriented programming much with my job, so the opportunity to delve into something like Go instead of a Javascript framework is much more enticing to me.

## Education:
#### From The University of South Carolina: 

  * Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems

  * Minor in Business Information Management
