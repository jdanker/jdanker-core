### On the Side - 
#### [This website](/) 
*Why Hugo?*

Originally I had a goal of building a personal website using React. I had built a project with Angular before, and my thought was *React is popular, right? I should learn that.* Turns out I don't love web development, especially the front end.

If you don't love doing something, it is extremely difficult to motivate yourself to learn it in your free time. So, I discovered the beauty of static site generators. 

Relatively straightforward to get setup, infinitely customizable.
