## Professionally -

### Mastercard, Software Engineer - Contractor  

*July 2021 - Present*

The majority of my work involves creating and maintaining automations, CI/CD processes, and supporting application deployments and infrastructure. (Traditional DevOps type stuff)

*My other non-engineering work, notably internships and IT work through college are listed in detail on my resume [here](/files/Resume.pdf)*


## On the Side - 
### [This website](/) 
My background is not web development. I am not a react or typescript wizard, but I think it's important for every developer to understand how the web works. Building and hosting my own website is a great way to get a feel for the infrastructure of the internet.

*Why Hugo?*

Hugo means I don't need to do frontend development, and can just focus on projects I enjoy, and link them here. Hugo is also written in Go, which I am learning now.


### [Advent Of Code](https://github.com/jdanker/adventofcode)
*What's this?*

My job does not require much object oriented programming, and I'd like to get back to that in my free time. I learn best through hands on work, and Advent of Code allows me to work through interesting challenges to grow my skillset. I plan to work through all the challenges, and then go back through and add tests in order to get familiar with testing in Go.

*Why Go?*

Go is fun, and modern. Kubernetes and Docker both are built on Go, so I think it's worth diving into what makes some of the most robust and popular DevOps platforms run. 

### [Cable Company Support Chatbot: Capstone Project](https://github.com/SCCapstone/CCChatbot)
*Completed May 2020*

During my senior year of college, our team created an AI chatbot for a fictional cable company to answer and maintain a basic online support system using Googleâ€™s Dialogflow for text recognition utilizing Google calendar API to create scheduling functionality. The chatbot uses firebase to log technician appointment information and customer service reports created by users.
